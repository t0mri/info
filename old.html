                    I'm a front-end developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS,
                    SASS, JavaScript, React, Redux, TypeScript, and Git. I'm also a graduate with a
                    bachelor's degree in computer science, which gives me a solid understanding of
                    functional and object-oriented programming. If you're looking for a talented
                    front-end developer, I'd love to chat with you about your project.

                    When faced with a problem, I first ask if it’s necessary to solve. Often, the
                    problem is unnecessary. For example, in my latest project, I had to check if
                    hero coors already existed in my data. Instead of finding a fast algorithm to
                    iterate, I changed the data structure, giving linear time complexity.

                    I’m a great fan of shifting perspectives and I always try to do that so that I
                    can achieve something that ordinary can’t. A simple example would be this
                    portfolio itself. I didn’t make my portfolio just as a showcase, I want you to
                    know who I am and what makes me special. So, instead of looking at top dev
                    portfolios, I looked at how movie directors present their ideas. That’s how I
                    got this theme and design.

                    Whenever I come up with an idea, I usually implement it in two different ways.
                    First, I write it to work as soon as possible, but it is not reusable or
                    modular. Once I make the whole thing work, I write the finest, robust, and
                    scalable code of the same algorithm, That scales with ease
